        Accordingly, the expected value of your project at continuation is $146,000. However, if you decide to abandon your project before it is completed, you will receive a sure payout of the salvage value of $177,500. Especially because of your constant willingness to go the extra mile, you have a high reputation as a project manager. When it comes to project decisions, your colleagues appreciate your input. In the following meeting next week it should be decided whether your project should be continued or abandoned.</li>
