<p>The experiment consists of <strong>three parts.</strong> Please read the following procedure carefully. You will then receive <u>three comprehension and four general questions.</u> Afterwards you will start the experiment directly as described below.
</p>

<br>

<ul class="list-group">
    <li class="list-group-item list-group-item-secondary" align="justify"><strong>Part 1: Lottery task</strong><br>
        First, you receive a lottery task. Its payout is an additional part of your compensation besides the fixed component of $4.25. You will find a detailed instruction on the corresponding page. All in all, the task is <strong>not related </strong> to the main part of the experiment.
        </li>
</ul>
  
<br>

<ul class="list-group">
    <li class="list-group-item list-group-item-secondary" align="justify"><strong>Part 2: Main part</strong><br>
        The main part includes <strong>four different tasks</strong>. The first task is an educational <strong>training </strong>for which you will be asked a few questions afterwards. The duration is about 15 minutes. Please always pay close attention. In the three tasks that follow, you have to <strong>make different decisions.</strong> Please note that these three tasks are <strong>independent</strong> of each other. You will find detailed instructions on the corresponding pages of the experiment. At the end of the main part you receive a few more knowledge questions. 
        </li>
</ul>

<br>

<ul class="list-group">
    <li class="list-group-item list-group-item-secondary" align="justify"><strong>Part 3: Questionnaire</strong><br>
        At last you should answer questions about your person. There are <strong>no right or wrong </strong>answers. Therefore, please be honest and read them carefully. Your answers have no influence on your compensation. All data will be treated <strong>anonymously</strong> by the experiment administration.
        </li>
</ul>
