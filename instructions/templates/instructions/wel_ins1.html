      <li class="list-group-item">This experimental study is conducted by the Justus-Liebig-University Gießen. Your answers will be treated completely anonymously. The experiment administration cannot draw any conclusions about you as a person.  </li>
      <li class="list-group-item">Please read all instructions and tasks carefully. Within the experiment several attention checks are asked. <strong>If it becomes apparent that you have often worked inattentively during this HIT, you will not be compensated.</strong></li>
      <li class="list-group-item"> <strong>The duration is about 40 minutes.</strong> Please process this HIT without any interruption. Since the experiment can include acoustic and optical elements, please make sure that your computer is able to display them.</li>
      <li class="list-group-item">This HIT is <strong>rewarded with a total of approximately $5.00.</strong> Overall the compensation comprises a fixed and a lottery component. If you end the experiment before completion, you will not receive any compensation.</li>
      <li class="list-group-item">There are no risks associated with participating in this HIT. This is a managerial instead of a psychological experiment. Therefore, you will not be fooled at any time. </li>
      <li class="list-group-item">In the following you have to answer two questions to verify that you meet the necessary qualifications to participate in the experiment. If you don’t pass these checks, the HIT will be over for you. </li> 
      <li class="list-group-item">If you have any questions about the experiment, please feel free to contact us at: <a href="mailto:jlustudy2020@gmail.com">jlustudy2020@gmail.com</a>. </li>
