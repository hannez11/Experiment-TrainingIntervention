    Let's take a look at another example. <br> Imagine you're about to undergo a life-or-death surgery. <br><br>Which of the following options would you rather choose? 
 </div>
 <style>
  img.Option {
   transition: transform 0.2s;
   position: absolute;
   z-index: 2;
  }
  img.Option:hover {

    Let’s see if you are already able to apply some of the lessons that we learnt today. Although both operations have the same outcome, our System 1 simply scans the information and intuitively chooses option A, as most people prefer to deal with positive rather than negative information. A 90% chance of survival may sound better than a 10% mortality rate.  </div>

    <div class="col-8 alert alert-dark" role="alert" align="justify">
        As you can see, just the way the information is presented can influence the outcome of our decisions. In some situations, this can lead to decisions being made prematurely. Only when System 2 turns active, it becomes apparent that the alternatives are the same. A suitable everyday example is the specification of the fat content of foods. If a company markets yoghurt with ‘10% less fat’ instead of ‘90% fat still contained’, the product is likely to be bought more often. Do you wonder how often you have been biased in your decision-making solely by the information that is presented to you?

        <span style="color:rgb(51, 172, 155)">Do not fall into this trap:</span> Be sure to pay attention to the information of the options that are presented to you. Now let’s have a look at a final example. <br><br>For this, let’s get back to our two ladies.

        <strong>Woman:</strong> “By the way, will you be at Max and Mara's wedding this weekend?” <br><br>
        <span style="color:white"><strong>Woman:</strong></span> “Oh, I would love to. Unfortunately, I've already booked a trip and paid for most of it. I don't get a refund if I cancel.”<br><br>
        <strong>Woman:</strong> “Oh, that‘s too bad. But the trip will be fantastic anyway.” <br><br>
        <span style="color:white"><strong>Woman:</strong></span> “I'm afraid not. The weather forecasts predict really bad weather for the duration of our stay. We may have to abandon our plans to go hiking. I would really rather be at the wedding if I only hadn't paid for the trip already. Not to mention all the time and effort it took me to plan the trip.” </div>

            What do you think about this example? What would you do if you were in her situation?
            At first glance, the young lady’s point of view seems to be understandable. Who likes to throw money out of the window? This is the intuitive solution to the problem generated by System 1. However, the person really seems to want to go to the wedding and the vacation probably will not be a pleasure. It would be better to do what promises the greater benefit, regardless of the costs already incurred. These costs can no longer be influenced anyway, only the future can. In such a situation you have to ignore the intuition of System 1.
