                    You have been working as a project manager in a company for several years. Your area of responsibility includes initiating lucrative projects as well as monitoring them and deciding on their further progress. The performance of these projects is always uncertain. Due to this uncertainty, decisions must be supported by several colleagues. You are very ambitious and always looking for outstanding projects.
              </ul>
                
              <br>
              
              <ul class="list-group">
                  <li class="list-group-item list-group-item-secondary"><strong>II. General information about the project</strong><br>
                    Four years ago, against the initial resistance of your colleagues, you were only able to implement such a project with great difficulty. You were convinced of the project idea from the start and saw first-class profit opportunities. The investment was worth $1 million and you estimated the annual returns at $270,000. Since the beginning you have put a lot of effort into the project and worked some overtime. Your expectations have been exceeded and the project has generated $330,000 annually for the first four years. The project is designed to have a life span of 7 years with 3 years remaining.  
                      </li>
              </ul>

                  <li class="list-group-item list-group-item-secondary"><strong>III. Current situation</strong><br>
                    However, doubts about the future performance of the project are now emerging. The annual cash flows are expected to decline to $50,000. If this is the case, the net present value is $144,327. On the contrary the net present value is estimated to be $177,500 if the project is abandoned. Especially because of your constant willingness to go the extra mile, you have a high reputation as a project manager. When it comes to project decisions, your colleagues appreciate your consulting skills. In the following meeting next week it should be decided whether the project, which  has  been  initiated  based  on  your  recommendation, should be continued or abandoned.
