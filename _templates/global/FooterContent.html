                      First, you receive a lottery task. <strong>Its payout is an additional part of your compensation besides the fixed component of $4.25.</strong> You will find a detailed instruction on the corresponding page. All in all, the task is not related to the main part of the experiment.

                      The main part includes four different tasks. <strong>The first task is a training for which you will be asked a few questions afterwards.</strong> The duration is about 15 minutes. Please always pay close attention. In the three tasks that follow, you have to make different decisions. <strong>Please note that these three tasks are independent of each other.</strong> You will find detailed instructions on the corresponding pages of the experiment. At the end of the main part you receive a few more knowledge questions.

                      At last you should answer questions about your person. There are no right or wrong answers. Therefore, please be honest and read them carefully. Your answers have no influence on your compensation. All data will be treated anonymously by the experiment administration.
